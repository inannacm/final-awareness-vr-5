      <h1>Product</h1>
      <br>

      <p>The product will be a series of guided, meditative sessions in VR that walk users through exploring the connection between their mind and reality. The style of sessions will be similar to those of Sam Harris on his Waking Up app (though in VR); exercises will have the implicit orientation of guiding users towards an awakened state/self-transcendence. The sessions build off the idea that experiencing the world through VR makes us question our reality outside of the VR headset. Consistent use of the exercises may provide mental health benefits. </p>

      <p>Similar to the style of widely used non-VR meditation apps (Calm,
Headspace, Waking Up), a narrator guides the meditation, meditations build
off of each other, and each course will focus on various aspects of meditation (see examples below). Content will be based on self-transcendence and mental health research. </p>
